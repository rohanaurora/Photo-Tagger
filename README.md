## Photo Tagger


This was Hootsuite's iOS Technical Challenge. This application lets users select an image associated with a word. 

![Objective](./iPhone%208.png)

Your task is to implement a couple of features:
* The UI is almost ready but we are missing an important piece: showing the images. Your first task is to finish implementing the UI so that the user can see the images on the screen.
* After completing the first task you should see a word and four images. Your next task is to select a new word and a new set of images. But keep these rules in mind:
  - Select a new word at random from the set of possible words by pressing the refresh button. Use a different word than the one currently displayed. For example, if you were showing Dog, don't show Dog the next time, but afterwards is fine.
  - Show all images that match the display tag.
