# Hootsuite iOS Technical Challenge

## Introduction

In this challenge you are going extend an existing application. This application lets users select an image associated with a word. It may not have many real-world applications but it does provide some interesting challenges.

Your task is to implement a couple of features:
* The UI is almost ready but we are missing an important piece: showing the images. Your first task is to finish implementing the UI so that the user can see the images on the screen.
* After completing the first task you should see a word and four images. Your next task is to select a new word and a new set of images. But keep these rules in mind:
  - Select a new word at random from the set of possible words by pressing the refresh button. Use a different word than the one currently displayed. For example, if you were showing Dog, don't show Dog the next time, but afterwards is fine.
  - Show all images that match the display tag.

### Keep in mind

- Treat this as you would treat any day-to-day task at work. This includes committing to git (locally) and testing where appropriate.
- Worry only about iPhone in portrait mode.
- Use your best coding practices, but done is better than perfect.
- iPhone 8.png is the UI of the project. (UI doesn't need to be pixel perfect)

## Submit

You have 90 minutes to complete the assignment. When you are done please zip the folder and email it back. Make sure to include the `.git` folder in the zip so that we can see your commit history.
